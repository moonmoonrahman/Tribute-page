	<p>Nelson Mandela is regarded the world over as one of history’s most inspirational figures. In every language and every country, Mandela’s legacy shines as a beacon of hope and healing, and as a potent reminder of the power of the human spirit to overcome impossible odds.

Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, into a royal family of the Thembu tribe, South Africa. His father died when he was only 9 years old and soon after, he was adopted by a regent who helped him develop his leadership skills.Madela was the first in his family to receive a formal education. One Nelson Mandela education quote insists on the fact that true power lies in knowledge so once he became president of the ANC (African National Congress), he managed to introduce universal free education to improve the living standards of the country’s black population.

Mandela, like Gandhi before him,<span><sub> was an ardent believer in the equal rights and potential of people of all origins and backgrounds. His courage in the face of oppression stands as an example of the power of passion and perseverance to change the world. Nelson Mandela was nearly executed for opposing the South African government’s segregationist policies, and was sentenced to 27 years in prison for fighting to dismantle the country’s apartheid regime.He spent the first 18 years at the brutal Robben Island Prison. Since he was a black political prisoner, he had even fewer privileges than other inmates. He lived all those years in a small cell, without a bed or plumbing, receiving less food than others, but forced to work twice as hard. Yet far from letting himself be broken or succumb to bitterness, when he was finally released in 1990, his sole focus was on healing his country’s divisions and bringing old enemies together to rebuild in common cause.

Mandela possessed an unshakeable belief in the power of empathy, honesty and dialogue to heal the deepest and most intractable wounds. His magnanimity towards his former oppressors won the admiration of South Africans and people around the world, and greatly eased his country’s transition to democracy. His lifelong pursuit of racial peace and reconciliation earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 — and the next year, Mandela became the first black president of South Africa, in a momentous election that for the first time allowed South Africans of all ethnic origins to vote.

We chose to share with you this list of Nelson Mandela quotes because his vision of a “rainbow nation” is more relevant today than it’s ever been, and his commitment to building bridges across the chasms that divide us holds a message that humanity has never needed more.</sub></span>
